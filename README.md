# CMS_machineLearning
project to explore machine learning techniques in event identification with the CMS detector

- anomalyDetection: a project aiming to use an autoencoder to identify anomalous signatures given some input N-dimensional input sample

- leptonIdentificationNN: project using a feed-forward neural network to predict whether a lepton from a top-antitop quark decay is an electron or a muon

- dihiggs4bNN: [very much in progress] project that will use NN architectures to distinguish dihiggs decays to four b quarks from the four b quark QCD background
