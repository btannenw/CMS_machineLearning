# Lepton Identification Using Neural Nets

## Introduction

This a project that aims to identify lepton flavor (electron or muon) from a sample of leptons produced in ttbar events. The neural nets used for identication are trained using only lepton kinematic information.

## Development Environment

I run this in a virtual environment on my machine to keep my research python environment separate from all other python development. This ensures that I can mess up one environment without ruining the other. 

### Setting up a Virtual Environment

Instructions to be added shortly.

### Installing the Necessary Packages

I used pip to install the necessary packages. To install the packages needed for this folder, run `pip install numpy sklearn matplotlib scipy uproot pandas` in your terminal window.
